# TBLG-U
This repository contains a MATLAB code for solving a Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian + Hartree interactions and Hubbard U atomic interactions for twisted bilayer graphene.  Four magnetic orderings can be selected, namely modulated anti‐ferromagnetic (MAFM), Nodal anti-ferromagnetic (NAFM) and hexagonal anti‐ferromagnetic (HAFM)
